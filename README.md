# Delivery Performance Analytics
**End-to-End SQL Analytics for OTIF and Delivery Reliability**

This project builds a SQL-first analytics system that models a logistics operation
end-to-end, from customer orders to final delivery.

It focuses on:
- OTIF (On-Time In-Full)
- Lead-time decomposition
- Root-cause analysis
- Cohort and trend analysis
- Incremental, production-style data processing

The project follows a lifecycle-based analytics design, from business problem
definition to automation.
